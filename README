A game based off of Tic-Tac-Toe where players alternate and place
numbers into a 3x3 board. The goal is to be the first player to
create a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line with numbers that sum
to 15. Each cell in that line must have had a valid number inputted
to count towards the 15. Players play locally on one keyboard.

Other Rules:

1. The x and y coordinates are 0 to 3.

2. Valid number inputs are 1 to 9; no number may be repeated on the
board.
